        My current research interests are:

        1. **AI-Driven Science**: Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence techniques to tackle complex scientific challenges, this research promotes interdisciplinary innovation and discovery that unveil novel scientific insights.

        2. **Data-Centric Learning**: Integrating universal graph models with large language models to significantly enhance data quantity, quality, efficiency, and privacy. This approach aims to optimize the robustness and scalability of machine learning systems for real-world applications.

        3. **Knowledge-Integrated LLMs**: Merging domain-specific knowledge with large language models to fortify their reasoning capabilities and adaptability, ultimately striving to develop more efficient and universally applicable intelligent solutions.

        Here are some of my research works. If you have any questions about them or would like to connect and explore new ideas together, I welcome the discussion. Please reach out to collaborate! üòÉ

        I genuinely believe that meaningful progress in academia stems from open dialogue and thoughtful debate. If you have ideas to share, constructive feedback on my work, or fresh perspectives you'd like to explore together, I would truly appreciate hearing from you.

        If you have any questions about my research‚Äîor if you‚Äôve previously contacted me through GitHub issues and haven‚Äôt received a response‚Äîplease feel free to reach out via email. I'm always happy to chat, collaborate, or offer assistance where I can.

        Throughout my academic journey, I‚Äôve been fortunate to receive support and inspiration from many generous people. I‚Äôm always eager to give back to the community and engage with others passionate about learning and discovery.

        That said, I'm not interested in discussions centered around citation counts, publication metrics, or quantitative comparisons between individuals. If your outreach is primarily motivated by such metrics, I kindly ask that you refrain from contacting me. I‚Äôm most interested in conversations about meaningful problems, creative solutions, and insightful ideas.

        *Please avoid contacting me at* `enjun_du@bit.edu.cn`, *as I will no longer have access to this address after June 2026.*
