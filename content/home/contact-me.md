I genuinely believe that meaningful progress in academia stems from open dialogue and thoughtful debate. If you have ideas to share, constructive feedback on my work, or fresh perspectives you'd like to explore together, I would truly appreciate hearing from you.

If you have any questions about my research—or if you’ve previously contacted me through GitHub issues and haven’t received a response—please feel free to reach out via email. I'm always happy to chat, collaborate, or offer assistance where I can.

**Preferred Email**:  
- [EnjunDu.cs@gmail.com](mailto:EnjunDu.cs@gmail.com)

**Optional Email**:  
- [edu719@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn](mailto:edu719@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn)

*Please avoid contacting me at* `enjun_du@bit.edu.cn`, *as I will no longer have access to this address after June 2026.*
