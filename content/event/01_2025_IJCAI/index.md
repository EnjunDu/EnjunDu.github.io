summary: |
  Oral presentation at IJCAI 2025 on our paper "ADC-GS: Anchor-Driven Deformable and Compressed Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction".

abstract: 'We present ADC-GS, a novel anchor-driven framework for dynamic scene reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting. By leveraging anchor-based compact Gaussian organization, coarse-to-fine deformation, and rate–distortion optimization, our method achieves significant improvements in memory efficiency, rendering speed, and reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that ADC-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing storage overhead by an order of magnitude compared to baselines.'

Our talk introduces **ADC-GS: Anchor-Driven Deformable and Compressed Gaussian Splatting**, a new method for **dynamic scene reconstruction** that balances storage efficiency and rendering quality.  
Key contributions include:

- Anchor-based compact Gaussian primitive organization  
- Coarse-to-fine anchor-driven deformation  
- Rate–distortion optimization for efficient rendering  

Experimental results demonstrate **state-of-the-art storage efficiency (3.8MB)** and **high-quality reconstruction (32.5dB)**, significantly outperforming existing baselines.  

Further event details are available at the [IJCAI 2025 website](https://ijcai25.org).
