        I genuinely believe that meaningful progress in academia stems from open dialogue and thoughtful debate. If you have any questions about my research--or if you've previously contacted me through GitHub issues and haven't received a response--please feel free to reach out via email. I'm always happy to chat, collaborate, or offer assistance where I can.

        Throughout my academic journey, I've been fortunate to receive support and inspiration from many generous people. I'm always eager to give back to the community and engage with others passionate about learning and discovery.

        That said, I'm not interested in discussions centered around citation counts, publication metrics, or quantitative comparisons between individuals. If your outreach is primarily motivated by such metrics, I kindly ask that you refrain from contacting me. I'm most interested in conversations about meaningful problems, creative solutions, and insightful ideas.

        **Preferred Email**:

        **Optional Email**:  
        - [edu719@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn](mailto:edu719@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn)

        *Please avoid contacting me at* `enjun_du@bit.edu.cn`, *as I will no longer have access to this address after June 2026.*
